# Karnaugh Map Solver

Karnaugh Map Solver made with Python with a Tkinter GUI 🐍

This was a university project done on my 2nd semester, so it can be improved.
The solver is alright for 2 and 3 variables. The solver for 4 varibles was left in progress.

Feel free to make any suggestions or improvements 😀
